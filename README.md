# in_class_activity_4

Here is my code for In-Class Activity 4.

My app contains:
- A Counter display that turns red when it is 0 and green when it exceeds 50. It will also not go below 0 or above 100, and will display a message when the limit is reached.
- A Slider that the user can move between 0 and 100.
- Increment, Decrement, Reset, and Undo buttons.
- A TextField box for inputing custom increment numbers that will throw a warning if the input is not a number.
- A History List that stores and shows values every time the counter is incremented or decremented.
